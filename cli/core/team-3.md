# Team 3: CLI Core Commands

## Description of Technology

1. **Python**: Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. For our team’s CLI Core Commands, we’ll be using Python to implement the various CLI functions required by the Osiris platform, ensuring smooth interaction between the command-line interface and the backend.

2. **gRPC**: gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework used for remote procedure calls. In our project, gRPC will facilitate communication between the CLI commands and the Osiris backend, enabling efficient and real-time interactions. This ensures that when commands are issued from our CLI, they can be processed by the backend in a scalable way.

3. **Docker**: Docker is a tool used for packaging applications into containers to ensure consistency across different environments. Each CLI command we create will be containerized using Docker, allowing us to test and deploy our commands in isolated environments. This is essential for maintaining compatibility across team members’ systems and will be integrated into the larger platform with the help of Team 9’s overall Docker orchestration.
